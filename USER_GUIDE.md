# The Celestial Harmonograph - Quick Start Guide

**An audio-reactive art visualizer that turns music into mesmerizing geometric patterns.**

---

## Getting Started

1. **Open the link** your friend shared
2. **Choose your audio source:**
   - **Use Microphone** - plays music from your speakers/headphones
   - **Upload Audio File** - load an MP3, WAV, or OGG file

That's it! The visualization will start automatically.

## What You're Seeing

Four invisible "planets" orbit at different speeds. Lines drawn between them create intricate, never-repeating patterns that react to your music:

| Music Element | Visual Response |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Bass/Kicks** | Screen pulses/thumps |
| **Pitch** | Orbits expand (low) or contract (high) |
| **Volume** | Lines get thicker and more electric |
| **Beats** | Colors shift and trails breathe |

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | What It Does |
|-----|--------------|
| `1` `2` `3` | Switch layout (Single / Dual / Triple split) |
| `Space` | Play / Pause audio |
| `R` | Clear the drawing |
| `S` | Save as PNG image |
| `P` | Open settings panel |
| `D` | Show beat detection debug view |
| `G` | Toggle physics mode (Legacy/Reactive) |
| `B` | Show/hide celestial bodies |

---

## Physics Modes

### Legacy Mode (Default)
Planets follow perfect circular orbits. The patterns are geometric and predictable, great for building clean, symmetrical designs.

### Reactive Mode (Press `G`)
The music controls gravity itself:
- **Bass** → Increases the sun's gravitational pull (planets get tugged inward)
- **Mids** → Speeds up orbital motion
- **Beats** → Create gravitational "shockwaves" that ripple through the system

This makes the orbits wobbly and unpredictable—planets spiral, stretch, and dance with the music. Press `B` to see the planets and sun reacting in real-time.

## Secret Setting: Chaos Mode

For an intense, vibrant experience, try this combination:

1. Press `P` to open Settings
2. Under **Planet Pairs**, enable multiple connections:
   - A-B (blue)
   - A-C (magenta)
   - B-C (yellow)
   - ...or all six!
3. Crank up:
   - **Line Opacity** → 60-80%
   - **Line Weight** → 1.5-2.0
   - **Electricity** → 80-100%
4. Toggle **Persistent Trails** on and off to switch between:
   - **ON** → Lines build up into dense, layered chaos
   - **OFF** → Live, breathing energy that never stops moving

This creates a wild, colorful web of intersecting patterns that pulses with the music.

## Try These Modes

### Triple Mode (Press `3`)
Splits the screen into three panels - Bass | Mid | Treble - each reacting to different frequencies. Great for electronic music!

### Persistent Trails (Default: ON)
Lines accumulate forever, building complex patterns. Turn OFF in settings for a "live" mode where lines fade quickly.

## Tips for Best Results

| Music Type | Recommended Settings |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Electronic/EDM** | Triple mode, high pulse strength |
| **Ambient/Classical** | Single mode, low electricity, let it build |
| **Live Performance** | Disable persistent trails, high opacity |
| **Maximum Chaos** | All pairs + Reactive mode + high electricity |
